<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Guy, and I’ve always had a deep appreciation for the intersection
  of logic, creativity, and purpose. Whether I’m working with data in Python to
  analyze restaurant trends or building user-friendly Windows Forms applications
  in C#, I find real satisfaction in solving problems and creating tools that
  make information more accessible and useful. I approach each project with
  curiosity and a desire to learn, always aiming to write clean, effective code
  that aligns with both function and form..
</p>

<p>
  In addition to my technical interests, I’m deeply connected to my heritage and
  identity. As a Jewish individual with roots in L'viv through the Zinder
  family, I carry a strong sense of history and responsibility, especially in
  the face of rising antisemitism. This awareness influences not only how Iview
  the world but also how I engage with it—grounded in empathy, resilience, and
  the pursuit of truth. It’s important to me to stay informed, thoughtful, and
  vocal about issues that matter.

<p>
  Outside of work and studies, I enjoy digging into meaningful projects, whether
  it’s analyzing real-worlddatasets, learning about horology and vintage
  timepieces, or refining the user experience of an app. I believe in continuous
  growth, respectful dialogue, and building things—whether digital or
  personal—that last. Each line of code, each insight, and each decision
  reflects the values I stand by.
